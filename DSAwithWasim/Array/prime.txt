ek example se samajhte hai 

    
    if given number is 36;
    total factor of 36 is

    1 X 36
    2 X 18
    3 X 12
    4 X 9
    6 X 6
    9 X 4
    12 X 3
    18 X 2
    36 X 1

    in above factor 36 1 aur 36 ke ilawa aur bhi number is divisible hai isliye wo prime
    number nahi hai 

    lekin ek baar ager hum factor pe nazar daale to ye dekhenge ki after 6 X 6 number's are 
    repeated to ager hum 6 X 6 tak condition check ker le to do we really need to check
    after 6 X 6? So answer is No.

    it's because ager 2 X 18 = 36 hota hai to obviously 18 X 2 = 36 hoga isliye 
    inseted of for(int i=2 ; i<n ; i++) runnig this loop we can run this loop 
    for(int i=2 ; i*i<=n ; i++) or for(int i=2 ; i<= under root n ; i++)

    time complexity would be Big O(under root n)

    if you didn't get concept yet take another example and try to dry run and apply above logic
    definetly you will get the idea how above logic is working.
