for example ek array diya hua hai 
    arr = {4,2,5,0,9,3};
    then NextPrumutation thik 425093 se bara hona array ke form me
    let's arrange the number and find some observation points

    here n = 6 means total 6! prumutation is possible means 720
    425039 this is one of them but it's not because 425039 is less than 425093 
    425309 this is one of them but it can be NextPrumutation of 425093 
    425930 this is one of them but it's not because it is greater than 425309
    i hope you got an idea
    so observation points are:- 
                                1). find the index of smallest number in the array form last
                                    (using loop)
                                2). once you got the index then sort the array in assending order after index till end of array 
                                    (apply any sorting algorithm but it is batter to use more optimize sorting)
                                3). after sorting we have to swap the index element and just greater than index element in the array after index and break the loop
